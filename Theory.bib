  abstract = {Eigenvector centrality is a common measure of the importance of nodes in a network. Here we show that under common conditions the eigenvector centrality displays a localization transition that causes most of the weight of the centrality to concentrate on a small number of nodes in the network. In this regime the measure is no longer useful for distinguishing among the remaining nodes and its efficacy as a network metric is impaired. As a remedy, we propose an alternative centrality measure based on the nonbacktracking matrix, which gives results closely similar to the standard eigenvector centrality in dense networks where the latter is well behaved but avoids localization and gives useful results in regimes where the standard centrality fails.},

It plays an important role in several other network analysis tools including community detection.

In this paper we propose a generic axiomatic framework to capture all the intrinsic properties of a centrality measure (a.k.a. centrality index).

A measure of centrality is rank monotone if after adding an arc x $\rightarrow$ y, all nodes with a score smaller than (or equal to) y have still a score smaller than (or equal to) y. If, in particular, all nodes with a score smaller than or equal to y get a score smaller than y (i.e., all ties with y are broken in favor of y), the measure is called strictly rank monotone. We prove that harmonic centrality is strictly rank monotone, whereas closeness is just rank monotone on strongly connected graphs, and that some other measures, including betweenness, are not rank monotone at all (sometimes not even on strongly connected graphs). Among spectral measures, damped scores such as Katz's index and PageRank are strictly rank monotone on all graphs, whereas the dominant eigenvector is strictly monotone on strongly connected graphs only.},

KPP-NEG is defined as the identification of key players for the purpose of disrupting or fragmenting the network by removing the key nodes.

  abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the structural determinants of power in exchange networks, along with research findings from laboratory experiments and a computer simulation of bargaining in network structures. Two theoretical traditions are dealth with: (1) point centrality in graph-theoretic representations of structure, as an approach to power distributions; and (2) power dependence principles applied to exchange networks. Measures of centrality available in the literature have the advantage of being easily applied to large and complex networks. In contrast, power dependence concepts were conceived for use in microsociology and are found to be cumbersome in the analysis of complex networks. But despite the relative difficulty of applying power-dependence theory to network structures, that approach generates hypotheses about power distributions which are confirmed at nearly every point in a laboratory experiment with five-person networks and at every point in a computer simulation of networks too large for laboratory study. In contrast, centrality measures applied to the type of networks studied fail to predict power distributions. Although centrality measures might predict power in some networks, their generality is limited. Toward resolution of the issues raised, this study offers two theoretical points: (1) a distinction between two different principles of "connection" in social networks suggests that current measures of centrality might predict power in one type of network but not in the other; and (2) it offers a first step toward a fusion of power-dependence theory and structural centrality in a way which might be general across networks of both types.},

Some recent work in the mathematical physics literature has shown that the exponential of a network's adjacency matrix can be used as the basis for defining and computing specific versions of these measures. We introduce here a general class of measures based on matrix functions, and show that a particular case involving a matrix resolvent arises naturally from graph-theoretic arguments. We also point out connections between these measures and the quantities typically computed when spectral methods are used for data mining tasks such as clustering and ordering. We finish with computational examples showing the new matrix resolvent version applied to real networks.},

  abstract = {Centrality measures, or at least popular interpretations of these measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which traffic flows through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the ``wrong'' answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality.},

  title = {Correlations among Centrality Measures in Complex Networks},
  abstract = {In this paper, we empirically investigate correlations among four centrality measures, originated from the social science, of various complex networks. For each network, we compute the centrality measures, from which the partial correlation as well as the correlation coefficient among measures is estimated. We uncover that the degree and the betweenness centrality are highly correlated; furthermore, the betweenness follows a power-law distribution irrespective of the type of networks. This characteristic is further examined in terms of the conditional probability distribution of the betweenness, given the degree. The conditional distribution also exhibits a power-law behavior independent of the degree which explains partially, if not whole, the origin of the power-law distribution of the betweenness. A similar analysis on the random network reveals that these characteristics are not found in the random network.},

  abstract = {Background Living systems are associated with Social networks \textemdash{} networks made up of nodes, some of which may be more important in various aspects as compared to others. While different quantitative measures labeled as ``centralities'' have previously been used in the network analysis community to find out influential nodes in a network, it is debatable how valid the centrality measures actually are. In other words, the research question that remains unanswered is: how exactly do these measures perform in the real world? So, as an example, if a centrality of a particular node identifies it to be important, is the node actually important?  Purpose The goal of this paper is not just to perform a traditional social network analysis but rather to evaluate different centrality measures by conducting an empirical study analyzing exactly how do network centralities correlate with data from published multidisciplinary network data sets.  Method We take standard published network data sets while using a random network to establish a baseline. These data sets included the Zachary's Karate Club network, dolphin social network and a neural network of nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Each of the data sets was analyzed in terms of different centrality measures and compared with existing knowledge from associated published articles to review the role of each centrality measure in the determination of influential nodes.  Results Our empirical analysis demonstrates that in the chosen network data sets, nodes which had a high Closeness Centrality also had a high Eccentricity Centrality. Likewise high Degree Centrality also correlated closely with a high Eigenvector Centrality. Whereas Betweenness Centrality varied according to network topology and did not demonstrate any noticeable pattern. In terms of identification of key nodes, we discovered that as compared with other centrality measures, Eigenvector and Eccentricity Centralities were better able to identify important nodes.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, a number of centrality metrics describing network properties of nodes have been proposed to rank the importance of nodes. In order to understand the correlations between centrality metrics and to approximate a high-complexity centrality metric by a strongly correlated low-complexity metric, we first study the correlation between centrality metrics in terms of their Pearson correlation coefficient and their similarity in ranking of nodes. In addition to considering the widely used centrality metrics, we introduce a new centrality measure, the degree mass. The mth-order degree mass of a node is the sum of the weighted degree of the node and its neighbors no further than m hops away. We find that the betweenness, the closeness, and the components of the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix are strongly correlated with the degree, the 1st-order degree mass and the 2nd-order degree mass, respectively, in both network models and real-world networks. We then theoretically prove that the Pearson correlation coefficient between the principal eigenvector and the 2nd-order degree mass is larger than that between the principal eigenvector and a lower order degree mass. Finally, we investigate the effect of the inflexible contrarians selected based on different centrality metrics in helping one opinion to compete with another in the inflexible contrarian opinion (ICO) model. Interestingly, we find that selecting the inflexible contrarians based on the leverage, the betweenness, or the degree is more effective in opinion-competition than using other centrality metrics in all types of networks. This observation is supported by our previous observations, i.e., that there is a strong linear correlation between the degree and the betweenness, as well as a high centrality similarity between the leverage and the degree.},

However, in most real situations, only limited sub-structures of entire networks are available, and therefore the reliability of the order relationships in sampled networks requires investigation. With a set of randomly sampled nodes from the underlying original networks, we rank individual nodes by three centrality measures: degree, betweenness, and closeness. The higher-ranking nodes from the sampled networks provide a relatively better characterisation of their ranks in the original networks than the lower-ranking nodes. A closeness-based order relationship is more reliable than any other quantity, due to the global nature of the closeness measure. In addition, we show that if access to hubs is limited during the sampling process, an increase in the sampling fraction can in fact decrease the sampling accuracy. Finally, an estimation method for assessing sampling accuracy is suggested.},

Beyond what is already known about the impact of data uncertainty, we found that the topology of a social network is, indeed, germane to the accuracy of these measures. In particular, our experiments show that the accuracy of identifying the prestigious, or key, actors in a network\textemdash{}according observed data\textemdash{}is considerably predisposed by the topology of the ground-truth network.},

  abstract = {To gain insights about dynamic networks, the dominant paradigm is to study discrete snapshots, or timeslices, as the interactions evolve. Here, we develop and test a new mathematical framework where network evolution is handled over continuous time, giving an elegant dynamical systems representation for the important concept of node centrality. The resulting system allows us to track the relative influence of each individual. This new setting is natural in many digital applications, offering both conceptual and computational advantages. The novel differential equations approach is convenient for modelling and analysis of network evolution and gives rise to an interesting application of the matrix logarithm function. From a computational perspective, it avoids the awkward up-front compromises between accuracy, efficiency and redundancy required in the prevalent discrete-time setting. Instead, we can rely on state-of-the-art ODE software, where discretization takes place adaptively in response to the prevailing system dynamics. The new centrality system generalizes the widely used Katz measure, and allows us to identify and track, at any resolution, the most influential nodes in terms of broadcasting and receiving information through time-dependent links. In addition to the classical static network notion of attenuation across edges, the new ODE also allows for attenuation over time, as information becomes stale. This allows `running measures' to be computed, so that networks can be monitored in real time over arbitrarily long intervals. With regard to computational efficiency, we explain why it is cheaper to track good receivers of information than good broadcasters. An important consequence is that the overall broadcast activity in the network can also be monitored efficiently. We use two synthetic examples to validate the relevance of the new measures. We then illustrate the ideas on a large-scale voice call network, where key features are discovered that are not evident from snapshots or aggregates.},

  abstract = {The non-trivial structure of such complex systems makes the analysis of their collective behavior a challenge. The problem is even more difficult when the information is distributed across networks (e.g., communication networks in different media); in this case, it becomes impossible to have a complete, or even partial picture, if situations are analyzed separately within each network due to sparsity. A multiplex network is well-suited to model the complexity of this kind of systems by preserving the semantics associated with each network. Centrality measures are fundamental for the identification of key players, but existing approaches are typically designed to capture a predefined aspect of the system, ignoring or merging the semantics of the individual layers. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we present a Framework for Tailoring Centrality Measures in Multiplex networks (TaCMM), which offers a flexible methodology that encompasses and generalizes previous approaches. The strength of TaCMM is to enable the encoding of specific dependencies between the subnets of multiplex networks to define semantic-aware centrality measures. We develop a theoretically sound iterative method, based on Perron-Frobenius theory, designed to be effective also in high-sparsity conditions. We formally and experimentally prove its convergence for ranking computation. We provide a thorough investigation of our methodology against existing techniques using different types of subnets in multiplex networks. The results clearly show the power and flexibility of the proposed framework.},

Closeness centrality is usually interpreted either as a measure of access efficiency or of independence from potential control by intermediaries. Betweenness and closeness are commonly assumed to be related for two reasons: first, because of their conceptual duality with respect to dependency, and second, because both are defined in terms of shortest paths. We show that the first of these ideas \textendash{} the duality \textendash{} is not only true in a general conceptual sense but also in precise mathematical terms. This becomes apparent when the two indices are expressed in terms of a shared dyadic dependency relation. We also show that the second idea \textendash{} the shortest paths \textendash{} is false because it is not preserved when the indices are generalized using the standard definition of shortest paths in valued graphs. This unveils that closeness-as-independence is in fact different from closeness-as-efficiency, and we propose a variant notion of distance that maintains the duality of closeness-as-independence with betweenness also on valued relations.},

  abstract = {Matrix-based centrality measures have enjoyed significant popularity in network analysis, in no small part due to our ability to rigorously analyze their behavior as parameters vary. One desirable property of a good centrality measure is that structurally equivalent nodes are assigned the same score (and dissimilar nodes are not). We show that when nodes are characterized into walk classes according to the number of incident \$$\backslash$ell\$-walks for all \$$\backslash$ell $>$ 0\$, even well-studied centrality measures can be "deceived" into assigning nodes with different walk structure the same score. Further, there are infinitely many parameter values and graphs on which these measures cannot distinguish nodes from distinct walk classes, and even the exponential function can produce uniform centrality scores on non--walk-regular graphs. Not all hope is lost, however, as we show that a broad class of functions including the matrix exponential and resolvent cannot be deceived for every parameter value in any set with a limit point.},

  title = {Consistency and Differences between Centrality Metrics across Distinct Classes of Networks},
  abstract = {The roles of different nodes within a network are often inferred via centrality analysis, which aims to quantify the potential for a node to influence, or be influenced by, others by virtue of network connectivity. Many different centrality measures have been proposed, but the degree to which they offer redundant or unique information, or whether it is advantageous to use multiple centrality measures to define node roles, is unclear. Here, we assess the correlations between 15 different centrality measures quantified in 11 networks, examine how these correlations relate to variations in network density and global topology, and clusters according to their centrality profiles to identify distinct node roles. We find that centrality measures are generally positively correlated, but that the strength of these correlations varies across networks and that this variation in related to the modularity and majorization gap of the network. Clustering of nodes based on centrality scores indicates that most networks contain a putative core, comprising nodes that score highly across nearly all measures. Our findings shed light on topological constraints that shape the pattern of correlations between centrality measures and demonstrate how a broad, comparative approach to centrality can inform the interpretation of nodal roles in networks.},

  title = {A Change of Perspective in Network Centrality},
  abstract = {Typing Yesterday into the search-bar of your browser provides a long list of websites with, in top places, a link to a video by The Beatles. The order your browser shows its search results is a notable example of the use of network centrality. Centrality is a measure of the importance of the nodes in a network and it plays a crucial role in a huge number of fields, ranging from sociology to engineering, and from biology to economics. Many metrics are available to evaluate centrality. However, centrality measures are generally based on ad hoc assumptions, and there is no commonly accepted way to compare the effectiveness and reliability of different metrics. Here we propose a new perspective where centrality definition arises naturally from the most basic feature of a network, its adjacency matrix. Following this perspective, different centrality measures naturally emerge, including the degree, eigenvector, and hub-authority centrality. Within this theoretical framework, the accuracy of different metrics can be compared. Tests on a large set of networks show that the standard centrality metrics perform unsatisfactorily, highlighting intrinsic limitations of these metrics for describing the centrality of nodes in complex networks. More informative multi-component centrality metrics are proposed as the natural extension of standard metrics.},

We argue that this feature can yield more meaningful rankings than traditional walk-based centrality measures. We show that the resulting Katz-style centrality measure may be computed via the so-called deformed graph Laplacian---a quadratic matrix polynomial that can be associated with any graph. By proving a range of new results about this matrix polynomial, we gain insights into the behavior of the algorithm with respect to its Katz-like parameter. The results also inform implementation issues. In particular we show that, in an appropriate limit, the new measure coincides with the nonbacktracking version of eigenvector centrality introduced by Martin, Zhang, and Newman in 2014. Rigorous analysis on star and star-like networks illustrates the benefits of the new approach, and further results are given on real networks.},

Degree, betweenness, and closeness centralities are defined only for classically simple graphs\textemdash{}those with strictly binary relations between vertices. Looking only at these classical graphs, where eigenvectors and graph\textendash{}theoretic measures are competitors, eigenvector centrality is designed to be distinctively different from mere degree centrality when there are some high degree positions connected to many low degree others or some low degree positions are connected to a few high degree others. Therefore, it will not be distinctively different from degree when positions are all equal in degree (regular graphs) or in core-periphery structures in which high degree positions tend to be connected to each other.},

The availability of network data and the recognition that social network techniques can provide an additional perspective have contributed to this expansion. Social network data are not always in a standard network form and, in many instances, consists of two distinct groups with ties between groups and no within group ties. For example, people attending events or meetings, authors collaborating on research outputs, or directors on boards of companies. Such data are known as two-mode data. Recently, Everett and Borgatti suggested a general approach for analyzing two-mode data. They suggested forming two one-mode data sets, analyzing these separately, and then recombining the results using the original data. One under-explored area in their work is in how this method can be applied to centrality problems; an issue we seek to begin to address here.},

  abstract = {The concept of centrality is often invoked in social network analysis, and diverse indices have been proposed to measure it. This paper develops a unified framework for the measurement of centrality. All measures of centrality assess a node's involvement in the walk structure of a network. Measures vary along four key dimensions: type of nodal involvement assessed, type of walk considered, property of walk assessed, and choice of summary measure. If we cross-classify measures by type of nodal involvement (radial versus medial) and property of walk assessed (volume versus length), we obtain a four-fold polychotomization with one cell empty which mirrors Freeman's 1979 categorization. At a more substantive level, measures of centrality summarize a node's involvement in or contribution to the cohesiveness of the network. Radial measures in particular are reductions of pair-wise proximities/cohesion to attributes of nodes or actors. The usefulness and interpretability of radial measures depend on the fit of the cohesion matrix to the one-dimensional model. In network terms, a network that is fit by a one-dimensional model has a core-periphery structure in which all nodes revolve more or less closely around a single core. This in turn implies that the network does not contain distinct cohesive subgroups. Thus, centrality is shown to be intimately connected with the cohesive subgroup structure of a network.},
